# Moqueca: Brazilian fish stew
#For the Fish: Combine the Mahi Mahi, shrimp, lime juice and zest, garlic, ginger, olive oil and paprika in a large bowl. Toss everything together to combine and let the fish marinate for 20-30 minutes.
#After marinating, drain the fish and shrimp of any excess liquid. Meanwhile, cook the rice according to the package directions. Once the rice is cooked, season with a little extra lime juice and zest, fluff and set aside.
#For the Stew: in a large heavy dutch oven, melt the olive oil over medium high heat. Add the paprika, garlic, red pepper flakes, onions and bell peppers and saut√© for 4-5 minutes until fragrant and the onions are softened. Add the chopped tomatoes and stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper.
#Reduce the heat to medium and nestle the marinated Mahi Mahi and shrimp in the bottom of the dutch oven. Season the fish with salt and pepper and then add the fish stock and coconut milk to the pan. It should just about cover the fish and shrimp.
#Bring the Moqueca stew to a simmer, cover, and cook for about 10 minutes until the shrimp is cooked and the fish easily flakes apart. Taste and season with the juice of 1 lime, more if you'd like, and add the cilantro, basil and more salt if desired. Serve the stew over the jasmine rice.
